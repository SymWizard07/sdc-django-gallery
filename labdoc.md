## High Level Purpose Statement
I want to test the prototyping ability of Django and its builtin support for sqlite by creating a simple digital art gallery.

## Experimental Design
I will create a simple digital art gallery where users can upload a created image and view other's images.

## Resources Available
Django docs, boilerplate extensions, ChatGPT

## Time Estimate
5-6 Hours. I will primarily be researching Django and learning how a basic app is set up.

## Experiment Notes
I found it to be easy to rapidly set up a backend for the app. Routing was very quick to accomplish, although static files took some deeper digging.

## Results
A client can use POST requests to send their artwork to the server, and view the gallery.

## Consequences for the Future

## Consequences for the Future
I initially chose this framework due to the small amount of overhead in setting up a web app, and it did not disappoint. I would definitely utilize this in combination with a future small project of mine. A microcontroller, for example, could utilize this very effectively to create a cheap online UI.
